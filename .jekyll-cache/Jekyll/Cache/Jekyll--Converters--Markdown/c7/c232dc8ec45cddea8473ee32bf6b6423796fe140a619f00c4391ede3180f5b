I"ç<p>Sparsely catalogued and difficult to synthesize, playbill collections are notoriously underutilized. At the centre of the ‚ÄúRomantic Melodrama‚Äù project is the British Library collection of playbills, which chronicles London and provincial performances from roughly 1780 to 1860. Four years ago these were made available digitally, though in unwieldy pdf files with high word-level reading error rates of over 40%. Although still incredibly useful, the collection, as it is currently digitized, is an imperfect finding aid; one can search for a given performance, actor, or keyword, but with no assurance that the results will be reliable or representative. Our team has recast the OCR for the entire British Library collection of 90,000 playbills using tools incorporating neural language models as well as traditional character recognition. This new process has lowered the word error rate to 8%, a result which will greatly facilitate data collection. This improved OCR provides the foundation for this project‚Äôs research.</p>

<p>Melodrama presents a rare opportunity to researchers of nineteenth-century culture interested not just in the emergence and proliferation of genres, but also in the networks that facilitate the evolution of cultural forms. Residing in staged performance yet producing a host of printed traces, melodrama reveals cultural relations otherwise invisible to literary historians.</p>
