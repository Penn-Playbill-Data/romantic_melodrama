I"¹<p>British theatre historians for the past half-century have depended on a resource called The London Stage 1660-1800 for much of our theatrical data. Providing dates, cast lists, returns, and snippets from reviews, its eleven volumes are invaluable and have inevitably shaped subsequent research. As its title suggests, The London Stage 1660-1800 cuts off just as melodrama is beginning; its focus on Londonâ€™s major theatres (Drury Lane, Covent Garden, the Haymarket, and the Kingâ€™s Theatre) necessarily excludes Britainâ€™s provincial stages and the many minor, â€˜illegitimateâ€™ houses scattered over the metropole. For information about these performances, researchers must comb newspapers and collections of playbills. This project will make two kinds of information newly new available:</p>

<p>â€¢ A richly-tagged, searchable database of every recorded performance and mention of melodrama in Britain between 1793 (the year of George Colmanâ€™s â€˜musical dramaâ€™ The Mountaineers) and 1843 (the year of the Theatre Regulation Act);</p>

<p>â€¢ Curated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) data of at least 100,000 playbills, and of significantly higher quality than that currently available.</p>
