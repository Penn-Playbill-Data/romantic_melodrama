__Romantic Melodrama: Feeling in Search of Form__ is a four-year British Academy-funded project sponsored by Queen Mary University of London. It aims to document every performance of melodrama in Britain before 1843. Taking its cues from early responses, where audiences experienced melodrama's powerful stage effects and highly wrought scenes of suspense as a sort of augmented reality, the project explores how the form's techniques (such as continuous music, extensive pantomime, and immersive soundscapes) created a new theatre of sensation that heightened the affective experiences of audiences. Finally, the research tracks how these same techniques also impacted writers working in other printed genres and media, repositioning melodrama--and theatrical performance more generally--as an exemplary and revealing form in Romantic culture.
