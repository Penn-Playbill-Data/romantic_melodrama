"Romantic Melodrama: Feeling in Search of Form" is a four-year British Academy funded project designed to understand the foundational role of melodrama in shaping aesthetic experience during the Romantic period. Its focus is the exhaustive documentation and detailed analysis of performances of melodrama in the first decades (1793-1843) of its popularity. This site will make available--in curated, searchable form--every recorded performance of melodrama in this time frame.
